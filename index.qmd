I am a researcher specializing in International Relations and Foreign Policy Analysis with a focus on Supply Chain geopolitics and Public Opinion. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Political Science at McGill University and a Research Fellow at the Central European Institute of Asian Studies. Before my PhD, I completed an MSc in International Political Economy at the London School of Economics and a Bachelor's degree in Quantitative Economics and Journalism at New York University

My Research focuses on investigating the political, economic, and social consequences of US-China Rivalry. Much of my work also engages with Canadian Foreign Policy, International soft-power dynamics, and debates surrounding de/re-globalization. In addition, I hold a special interest in advanced methodology in the quantitative realm.
